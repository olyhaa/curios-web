# Curios Web Clone

***This application is a work in progress!***

A playground for some React work. This is based on the [Curios Board Game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/275973/curios). It only supports single player mode, with a super-basic computer player (based on random actions). Design and UX are minimalistic, maybe one day I'll get around to making it pretty!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
